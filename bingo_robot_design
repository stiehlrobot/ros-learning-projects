Bingo_hardware

  Arduino Mega - interface to sensors and actuators
  Raspberry Pi 3 - Provides WIFI

  10,000 mAH Powerbank for arduino - OK
  6 V battery pack for steppers - OK
  6 V DC motors with encoders - Main actuators of robot, connected to wheels ENCODERS TODO
  Motor driver board - TB6612FNG OK
  Ultrasonic sensor - to calculate distance to objects infront of robot, for obstacle avoidance OK
  Ir sensor - to calculate distance to objects infront, for obstacle avoidance OK
  Temperature & humidity sensor grove - to measure temperature and humidity OK
  IMU - acceleration and gyro OK  
  Switch - to control 6V battery pack OK
  
  Tamiya components for chassis
  2 motor independent gearbox for type 130 DC motors
  Tamiya Sports Tire Set - 56 mm diameter
  

Software high level architechture:

  Communication protocal - ROSSerial

  PC - ros master
  Arduino - Ros node, subscriber (/cmd_vel), publisher (/Pose)
  Raspberry Pi - Ros node

bonus:

  Servo with ir range detector - to create point cloud of obstacle data (needs bigger chassis probably)
  LED lights for state -
  Battery state reader - 
  obstacle detection options and lidars tested -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddxguAzzzJE
