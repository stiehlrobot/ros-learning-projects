This is a structure for my learning path into ros and robotics
General todos:

- find a 5V power supply
- find parts for robot wheel to stepper pin connection


Stage 1 - Basics of ROS
  a. Ros nodes [x]
  b. Publishers [x]
  c. Subscribers [x]
  d. Topics [x]
  e. Messages [x]
  f. Services [x]
  g. Launch files [x]
  h. Command line tools for debugging [x]
  
  
Stage 2 - ROS with Arduino
  a. Set up rosserial libraries for Arduino [x]
    1. Instructions for setup: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
  b. Basic communication with Arduino - Change LED state [x]
  c. Read sensor values from Grove Temperature and Humidity sensor using I2C bus [x]
    1. Used combination of this https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Temper_Humidity_TH02 and ros_lib Temperature example to publish on two separate ros topics
    2. Created a rosnode to subscribe to /temperature and /humidity topics to print out temp and humidity values
  d. Read ultrasonic sensor values from Arduino [x]
    1. Used this tutorial to read HC SR04 Ultrasonic sensor values from Serial monitor: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/complete-guide-for-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/
    2. Create a rosserial node on arduino to read distance value and publish it to topic ultrasonic_distance
  e. Control a stepper via rosserial using Motor Driver board ZC-A0591 [x]
  f. Write basic movement functions for steppers: forward, backward, turn(direction, time)
  g. Control two motors via rosserial from another node using publisher -- subscriber []
  h. Build 4 wheeled robot with arduino mega []
  i. control four wheeled robot using ros twist teleop key []
  j. Publish a message sent via rosserial to LCD display of arduino [x]
    1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS1rGdFrBd4 using this tutorial to connect lcd to arduino
  k. Connect IMU Accel, Gyro, Temp to Arduino and print values in Serial [x]
    1. Test on robot how values change as robot turns etc. 
    2. Library for sensor: https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Accelerometer_And_Gyroscope_LSM6DS3/blob/master/README.md
  l. Connect and test IR Distance Interrupter v1.2 [x]
    1. Calibrated sensor using onboard pot
    2. Read sensorvalues

Stage 3 - ROS with Raspberry Pi 3
  a. Set up raspberry pi ros with ubiquityrobot image [x]
    1. Used this tutorial: https://learn.ubiquityrobotics.com/workstation_setup
  b. Set up a publisher on Raspberry Pi node, communicate over Wifi [x]
  c. Control a led on Raspberry Pi []

Stage 4 - ROS with gazebo
  a. Object Irritational Robot using turtlebot 3 simulation [x]
 
  
Stage 5 - Mobile robot kinematics
  a. Understand this: https://husarion.com/tutorials/ros-tutorials/3-simple-kinematics-for-mobile-robot/
  b. Use this for connecting the encoder: http://andrewjkramer.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/motor-encoder-wiring.png
  
Stage 6 - Rotary motor encoders
  a. check this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1txmR8GXzE
