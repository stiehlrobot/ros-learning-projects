This is a structure for my learning path into ros and robotics


Stage 1 - Basics of ROS
  a. Ros nodes [x]
  b. Publishers [x]
  c. Subscribers [x]
  d. Topics [x]
  e. Messages [x]
  f. Services [x]
  g. Launch files [x]
  h. Command line tools for debugging [x]
  
  
Stage 2 - ROS with Arduino
  a. Set up rosserial libraries for Arduino [x]
    1. Instructions for setup: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup
  b. Basic communication with Arduino - Change LED state [x]
  c. Read sensor values from Grove Temperature and Humidity sensor using I2C bus [x]
    1. Used combination of this https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Temper_Humidity_TH02 and ros_lib Temperature example to publish on two separate ros topics
    2. Created a rosnode to subscribe to /temperature and /humidity topics to print out temp and humidity values
  d. Read ultrasonic sensor values from Arduino [x]
    1. Used this tutorial to read HC SR04 Ultrasonic sensor values from Serial monitor: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/complete-guide-for-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04/
    2. Create a rosserial node on arduino to read distance value and publish it to topic ultrasonic_distance
  e. Control a stepper via rosserial using Motor Driver board ZC-A0591 []
  f. Control a servo via rosserial using PC 9655 pwm driver board
  g. Control two motors via rosserial from another node using publisher -- subscriber
  h. Build 2 wheeled robot with arduino mega []
  i. control two wheeled robot using ros twist teleop key []
  j. Publish a message sent via rosserial to LCD display of arduino []
    1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS1rGdFrBd4 using this tutorial to connect lcd to arduino

Stage 3 - ROS with Raspberry Pi 3
  a. Set up raspberry pi ros []
  b. Set up a publisher on Raspberry Pi node, communicate over Wifi []
  c. Control a led on Raspberry Pi

Stage 4 - ROS with gazebo
  a. Object Irritational Robot using turtlebot 3 simulation
